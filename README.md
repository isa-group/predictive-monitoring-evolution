# predictive-monitoring-evolution

This repository contains code and datasets for managing the evolution of predictive monitoring models. 

In particular it contains the code for the analysis of the [BPI 2015 datasets](https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:270fd440-1057-4fb9-89a9-b699b47990f5) and the [TRAFFIC dataset](https://doi.org/10.4121/uuid:31a308ef-c844-48da-948c-305d167a0ec1). It does not contain the code for the ITA dataset because it is not publicly available due to privacy agreement.

All experiments are designed to be fully replicable only with the code and data contained in this repository.
